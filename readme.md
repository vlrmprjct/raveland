# Raveland

**Raveland** is a complete remake and refactoring of the original "Word Problems" audio visualizer. This project visualizes audio signals in real-time using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). The goal is to make sounds come alive through interactive and stunning visuals.

## Features

- ðŸŒŠ **Audio Visualization**: Real-time display of frequency bands and sound waves.
- ðŸŽ¨ **Three.js Integration**: Powerful 3D graphics rendering.
- ðŸ”§ **Modern ES6 Module Setup**: Entirely rewritten using modern JavaScript.
- ðŸš€ **Vite-Powered**: Fast development and easy build process.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

Make sure these tools are installed before you start.
